During a comparison, you can always change your\npoints by clicking on\nComparing branches\nThe most common use of Compare is to compare branches, such as when you're starting a new pull request. You'll always be taken to the branch comparison view when starting\na new pull request\nTo compare branches, you can select a branch name from the\ndrop down menu at the top of the page.\nHere's an example of a\ncomparison between two branches\nComparing tags\nComparing release tags will show you changes to your repository since the last release.\nFor more information, see\nComparing releases\nTo compare tags, you can select a tag name from the\ndrop-down menu at the top of the page.\nHere's an example of a\ncomparison between two tags\nIf a branch and a tag have the same name, the branch will be used when comparing commits. You can compare the tag specifically by adding\nto the tag name.\nComparing commits\nYou can also compare two arbitrary commits in your repository or its forks on GitHub in a two-dot diff comparison.\nTo quickly compare two commits or Git Object IDs (OIDs) directly with each other in a two-dot diff comparison on GitHub, edit the URL of your repository's \"Comparing changes\" page.\nFor example, this URL uses the shortened SHA codes to compare commits\nhttps://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/compare/f75c570..3391dcc\nTo learn more about other comparison options, see\nAbout comparing branches in pull requests\nComparing across forks\nYou can compare your base repository and any forked repository. This is the view that's presented when a user performs a Pull Request to a project.\nTo compare branches on different repositories, preface the branch names with user names. For example, by specifying\noctocat:main\nocto-org:main\n, you can compare the\nbranch of the repositories respectively owned by\nYou can also preface the branch name with a user name and a repository name. For example, specifying\noctocat:awesome-app:main\nwould use the\nbranch in the\noctocat/awesome-app\nrepository. This can be useful in large organizations, where you might have an upstream repository and a fork both owned by the organization. For more information, see\nAbout forks\nHere's an example of a\ncomparison between two repositories\nComparisons across commits\nYou can compare a single commit in Git to the commit's predecessors using two types of notation.\nOne commit prior.
