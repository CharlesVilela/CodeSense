You can use your profile to:\nyour interests and skills.\nyour projects and contributions.\nyour identity and show the GitHub community who you are.\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to personalize your profile by adding a profile picture, bio, and a profile README.\nYou'll also learn the basics of Markdown syntax, which is what you'll use to format any writing you do on GitHub.\nPrerequisites\nYou must have a GitHub account. For more information, see\nCreating an account on GitHub\nAdding a profile picture and bio\nFirst, we'll add a picture to your profile. Your profile picture helps identify you across GitHub.\nAdding a profile picture\nIn the upper-right corner of any page, click your existing profile avatar, then, from the dropdown menu, click\nUnder \"Profile Picture\", select\n, then click\nUpload a photo...\nSelect an image, then click\nCrop your picture.\nSet new profile picture\nNext, we'll add some basic information about yourself to share with other GitHub users. This information will display below your profile picture on your profile page.\nAdding a bio\nOn your profile page, under your profile picture, click\nEdit profile\nUnder \"Bio\", write one or two sentences about yourself, such as who you are and what you do.\nKeep the bio short; we'll add a longer description of your interests in your profile README in the section below.\nTo add an emoji to your bio, visit\nEmoji cheat sheet\nand copy and paste an emoji into the \"Bio\" dialog box.\nOptionally, add your preferred pronouns, workplace, location and timezone, and any links to your personal website and social accounts. Your pronouns will only be visible to users that are signed in to GitHub.\nAdding a profile README\nNext, we'll create a special repository and README file that will be displayed directly on your profile page.\nYour profile README contains information such as your interests, skills, and background, and it can be a great way to introduce yourself to other people on GitHub and showcase your work.\nAs we learned in the\nHello World\nfiles are written using Markdown syntax (note the\nfile extension), which is just a way to format plain text.\nIn the following steps, we'll create and edit your profile README.\nStep 1: Create a new repository for your profile README\nIn the upper-right corner of any page, select\n, then click\nNew repository\nUnder \"Repository name\", type a repository name that matches your GitHub username. For example, if your username is \"octocat\", the repository name must be \"octocat.\"\nOptionally, in the \"Description\" field, type a description of your repository. For example, \"My personal repository.\"\nCreate repository\nStep 2: Edit the\nnext to your profile README.\nIn the \"Edit\" view, you'll see some pre-populated text to get you started. On line 1, delete the text that says\n### Hi there\nIn Markdown syntax,\nrenders the plain text as a small (\"third-level\") heading, while\nrenders a second- and first-level heading respectively.\nToggle to \"Preview\" to see how the plain text now renders. You should see the new text displayed as a much larger heading.\nToggle back to the \"Edit\" view.\nDelete line 3 and line 16.\nThis HTML syntax (e.g.\n) is keeping the other lines hidden when you toggle to \"Preview\".\nComplete some of the prompts on lines 8 to 15, and delete any lines you don't want. For example, add your interests, skills, hobbies, or a fun fact about yourself.\nNow, toggle to \"Preview\". You should see your completed prompts render as a bulleted list.\nToggle back to \"Edit\" and remove any other lines of text that you don't want displayed on your profile.\nKeep customizing and editing your profile README.\nEmoji cheat sheet\nto add emojis.\nMarkdown cheat sheet\nto experiment with additional Markdown formatting.\nStep 3: Publish your changes to your profile\nWhen you're happy with how your profile README looks in \"Preview\", and you're ready to publish it, click\nCommit changes..\nIn the open dialog box, simply click again\nCommit changes\nNavigate back to your profile page. You will see your new profile README displayed on your profile.\nIf you want to learn more Markdown syntax and add more sophisticated formatting to your profile README, see\nQuickstart for writing on GitHub\nAlternatively, try the\nGitHub Skills\n\"Communicate using Markdown\" course.\nIn the next tutorial,\nFinding inspiration on GitHub\n, we'll look at ways you can explore GitHub to find projects and people that interest you.\nFurther reading\nAbout your profile\nPersonalize your profile\nBasic writing and formatting syntax",
