Your own workloads are not impacted.\nYou might notice missing logs or metrics for your nodes if the new service agent doesn't have the necessary permissions.\nWhat do I need to do?\nIn the vast majority of cases, no action is needed, as the role\nrole/container.defaultNodeServiceAgent\nhas been automatically granted to the new GKE Node Service Agent on your cluster project.\nHowever, you will need to re-apply the role\nrole/container.defaultNodeServiceAgent\nto the new service agent in the following scenarios:\nYou have automation that might have removed this role.\nYou notice missing

This resulted in non-zero Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2. This inconsistency arose from evolving RE100 market-boundary guidance following Brexit. While RE100 guidance excludes the UK from the EU market-boundary post-Brexit, it allows for the use of previously purchased EU energy attribute certificates (EACs) with sufficiently close vintages to be applied against UK consumption in 2024. Google's application of these EACs to UK consumption results in zero Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London).\nWe have corrected our data to align with the RE100 market boundaries guidance and our corporate environmental reporting of matched renewable energy. Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2 are now correctly reported as zero for July 2025, using 2024 renewable energy coverage consistent with Google's environmental report.\nTo correct your historical data, please\nrun a backfill\nfor July 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for August 15, 2025, which will then update the July 2025 data in your BigQuery table.\nData for August 2025, available on September 15, 2025, will automatically reflect this correction. Data for all previous periods remains unaffected.\nCloud Healthcare API\nAccept-Encoding\ncompression headers on DICOM frame requests that contain\nuncompressed pixel data (as defined by the DICOM transfer syntax) are now\nsupported and can return compressed results\n: For very large downlinks and very large files where downlink vastly\noutpaces compression speed, latency may slightly increase. Compression can be\ndisabled by not including the header in these cases.\nCloud Load Balancing\nThe global and classic external Application Load Balancers implemented on Google Front-Ends (GFEs) now support HTTP/1.0 explicitly as a protocol during ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) negotiation.\nPreviously, when the GFEs didn't support HTTP/1.0 explicitly, the GFE would return an\nresponse, disable ALPN, and fall back to using HTTP/1 (which includes HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1)  as the default application protocol. After this change, GFEs will instead return\n, which provides clients with positive confirmation that their advertised\nwas accepted.\nYou are not expected to make any changes with this update. If a TLS handshake with HTTP/1.0 is unsuccessful, please contact\nCloud SQL for PostgreSQL\nIf a specific active query is blocked or running much longer than expected, it can block other dependent queries. Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL offers an optional feature that lets you terminate specific long-running or blocked active queries.\nFor more information, see\nBlocked active queries (Preview)\nCompute Engine\n: H4D VMs, designed for high performance computing (HPC) workloads, are now in preview.

The result\nis that attack paths are more accurate in relation to networking. Certain\ncustomers with specific Google Cloud subnet configurations, for example, when a\nVPC connector accesses a subnetwork, may see significant changes to toxic\ncombinations, chokepoints, and attack exposure scores.\nVirtual Private Cloud\nYou can create a VPC network that supports RDMA over\nFalcon transport\n, which lets you run AI and high performance computing (HPC) workloads on VM instances that have the\nnetwork interface type in Google Cloud, such as H4D instances.

Agent desktop is a customizable interface that provides agents quick access to the information and tools they need to handle customer sessions. The desktop layout includes the agent adapter as well as configurable panels that display information or tools. You can configure a distinct desktop layout for each session type: inbound calls, outbound calls, or chats. You can then configure which desktop layout that an agent sees when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can also configure announcements to communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. For more information, see\nAgent desktop\nThe agent desktop provides the following capabilities:\nCreate desktop layouts\n. With agent desktop, you can create customized desktop layouts for different use cases for your human agents. These include receiving inbound calls, placing outbound calls, and handling chat sessions. Your layouts can contain call adapters, chat adapters, and a wide variety of panels for other capabilities such as live transcripts, knowledge assist, disposition codes, and session data feeds. You can also configure custom panels to use as widgets that you can drag into panels. For more information, see\nCreate desktop layouts\nConfigure custom panels\n. A custom panel displays one or more URLs for external resources. These can be documentation, tools, or other resources. A custom panel appears as a widget in the desktop layout builder. Then, when you create desktop layouts, you can drag widgets into panels. For more information, see\nConfigure custom panels\nUse widgets\n. Widgets are containers of specific functionality that you can drag into panels in the desktop layout builder. The desktop layout builder comes with a number of pre-defined widgets, such as\nSession Data Feed\nDisposition Codes and Notes\nKnowledge Assist\nLive Transcript\nConfigure desktop layouts for agents\n. You can configure which desktop layout that agents see when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can configure this globally, at the queue level, and at the team level. Queue-level layout settings take priority over global settings. Team-level settings take priority over both queue-level settings and default settings. For more information, see\nConfigure desktop layouts for agents\nConfigure announcements\n. With announcements, you can communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. Announcements appear in the agent desktop as notification banners that persist until the agent dismisses them. Announcements also appear in the agent's announcement list.

This research establishes a more comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy, emissions, and water consumption of AI inference in a live production environment. Our goal is to promote greater transparency and encourage the industry to align on more standardized, comprehensive measurement frameworks.\nCurrently, the data in Google Cloud Carbon Footprint for AI services does not fully reflect this comprehensive approach, which we believe is the most transparent environmental impact assessment from AI labs today. To better align with this new, more detailed methodology, we will be updating our carbon accounting pipeline for services that use AI, such as Vertex AI.\nThe new methodology provides a more accurate and complete picture of the environmental impact of AI services. We anticipate that this change, which will be implemented during our next semi-annual methodology refresh, may result in an increase in the emissions data for some of our Cloud AI services. However, we believe this move to more actionable data will enable us to more readily incentivize and track optimizations for these AI services.\nThe updated data will be released with the January 2026 methodology refresh, which is expected to be available in mid-February 2026. We believe this is an important step toward providing you with the most accurate and actionable data possible to manage your cloud usage more sustainably.\nCloud Composer\n(Cloud Composer 2)\nCloud Composer's high availability infrastructure was\nenhanced to provide greater resilience against zonal outages.
