  "content": "What is Amazon EC2?\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web\nServices (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy\napplications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you\nneed, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up)\nto handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website\ntraffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.\nAn EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance,\nthe instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance.\nEach instance type offers a different balance of compute, memory, network, and storage\nresources. For more information, see the\nAmazon EC2 Instance Types Guide\nFeatures of Amazon EC2\nAmazon EC2 provides the following high-level features:\nVirtual servers.\nAmazon Machine Images (AMIs)\nPreconfigured templates for your instances that package the components you\nneed for your server (including the operating system and additional\nInstance types\nVarious configurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and\ngraphics hardware for your instances.\nAmazon EBS volumes\nPersistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).\nInstance store volumes\nStorage volumes for temporary data that is deleted when you stop,\nhibernate, or terminate your instance.\nSecure login information for your instances. AWS stores the public key\nand you store the private key in a secure place.\nSecurity groups\nA virtual firewall that allows you to specify the protocols, ports, and\nsource IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP\nranges to which your instances can connect.\nAmazon EC2 supports the processing, storage, and transmission\nof credit card data by a merchant or service provider, and has been\nvalidated as being compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS).\nFor more information about PCI DSS, including how to request a copy of the AWS PCI Compliance Package,\nPCI DSS Level 1\nRelated services\nServices to use with Amazon EC2\nYou can use other AWS services with the instances that you deploy using Amazon EC2.\nAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling\nHelps ensure you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to\nhandle the load for your application.\nAutomate backing up your Amazon EC2 instances and the Amazon EBS volumes attached to\nAmazon CloudWatch\nMonitor your instances and Amazon EBS volumes.\nElastic Load Balancing\nAutomatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple\nAmazon GuardDuty\nDetect potentially unauthorized or malicious use of your EC2 instances.\nEC2 Image Builder\nAutomate the creation, management, and deployment of customized, secure, and\nup-to-date server images.\nAWS Launch Wizard\nSize, configure, and deploy AWS resources for third-party applications\nwithout having to manually identify and provision individual AWS\nAWS Systems Manager\nPerform operations at scale on EC2 instances with this secure end-to-end\nmanagement solution.\nAdditional compute services\nYou can launch instances using another AWS compute service instead of using Amazon EC2.\nAmazon Lightsail\nBuild websites or web applications using Amazon Lightsail, a cloud platform\nthat provides the resources that you need to deploy your project quickly, for\na low, predictable monthly price. To compare Amazon EC2 and Lightsail, see\nAmazon Lightsail or Amazon EC2\nAmazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\nDeploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on a cluster of EC2\ninstances. For more information, see\nChoosing an AWS container service\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)\nRun your Kubernetes applications on AWS.  For more information, see\nChoosing an AWS container service\nAccess Amazon EC2\nYou can create and manage your Amazon EC2 instances using the following interfaces:\nAmazon EC2 console\nA simple web interface to create and manage Amazon EC2 instances and resources.\nIf you've signed up for an AWS account, you can access the Amazon EC2 console\nby signing into the AWS Management Console and selecting\nthe console home page.\nAWS Command Line Interface\nEnables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. It\nis supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux. For more information about the\nAWS CLI , see\nAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\n. You can find the Amazon EC2 commands in the\nAWS CLI Command Reference\nAWS CloudFormation\nAmazon EC2 supports creating resources using AWS CloudFormation. You create a template, in JSON or YAML\nformat, that describes your AWS resources, and AWS CloudFormation provisions and\nconfigures those resources for you. You can reuse your CloudFormation\ntemplates to provision the same resources multiple times, whether in the\nsame Region and account or in multiple Regions and accounts. For more\ninformation about supported resource types and properties for Amazon EC2, see\nEC2 resource type\nAWS CloudFormation User Guide\nIf you prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead\nof submitting a request over HTTP or HTTPS, AWS provides libraries, sample\ncode, tutorials, and other resources for software developers. These\nlibraries provide basic functions that automate tasks such as\ncryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and handling\nerror responses, making it easier for you to get started. For more\ninformation, see\nTools to Build\nAWS Tools for PowerShell\nA set of PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by\nthe SDK for .NET. The Tools for PowerShell enable you to script operations on your AWS\nresources from the PowerShell command line. To get started, see the\nAWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide\n. You can find the cmdlets for Amazon EC2, in the\nAWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference\nAmazon EC2 provides a Query API. These requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that\nuse the HTTP verbs GET or POST and a Query parameter named\n. For more information about the API actions for\nAmazon EC2, see\nAmazon EC2 API Reference\nPricing for Amazon EC2\nAmazon EC2 provides the following pricing options:\nYou can get started with Amazon EC2 for free. To explore the Free Tier options,\nAWS Free Tier\nOn-Demand Instances\nPay for the instances that you use by the second, with a minimum of 60\nseconds, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.\nSavings Plans\nYou can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a consistent\namount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years.\nReserved Instances\nYou can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a specific\ninstance configuration, including instance type and Region, for a term of 1\nor 3 years.\nSpot Instances\nRequest unused EC2 instances, which can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs\nsignificantly.\nDedicated Hosts\nReduce costs by using a physical EC2 server that is fully dedicated for\nyour use, either On-Demand or as part of a Savings Plan. You can use your\nexisting server-bound software licenses and get help meeting compliance\nrequirements.\nOn-Demand Capacity Reservations\nReserve compute capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability\nZone for any duration of time.\nPer-second billing\nRemoves the cost of unused minutes and seconds from your bill.\nFor a complete list of charges and prices for Amazon EC2 and more information about the purchase\nmodels, see\nAmazon EC2 pricing\nEstimates, billing, and cost\noptimization\nTo create estimates for your AWS use cases, use the\nAWS Pricing Calculator\nTo estimate the cost of transforming\nto a modern architecture that uses open source and\ncloud-native services deployed on AWS, use the\nModernization Calculator for Microsoft Workloads\nTo see your bill, go to the\nBilling and Cost Management\nAWS Billing and Cost Management\n. Your bill contains links to usage reports that provide details\nabout your bill. To learn more about AWS account billing, see\nAWS Billing and Cost Management User\nIf you have questions concerning AWS billing, accounts, and events,\ncontact AWS Support\nTo calculate the cost of a sample provisioned\nenvironment, see\nCloud Economics\nWhen calculating the cost of a provisioned\nenvironment, remember to include incidental costs such as snapshot storage for EBS\nYou can optimize the cost, security, and performance of your AWS environment\nAWS Trusted Advisor\nYou can use AWS Cost Explorer to analyze the cost and usage of your EC2 instances. You can view\ndata up to the last 13 months, and forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next\n12 months.
